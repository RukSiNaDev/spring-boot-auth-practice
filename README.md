- âœ… Refactoring code structure (e.g., separating services, using DTOs) 
- âœ… Exception handling best practices

## How to Run ðŸš€
### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Java JDK 17+ (required for Spring Boot)
- Maven (for building and running the project)
- SQLite (database)
- Eclipse IDE (optional, for development)
- DBeaver (optional, for managing the database)
- Postman (for testing REST APIs)

## Steps

1. Clone the repository:
<pre> <code>
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-auth-practice.git
cd spring-boot-auth-practice
</code> </pre>

2. Build and run the project with Maven:
<pre> <code>
mvn spring-boot:run
</code> </pre>

3. Configure your SQLite database (the default configuration should already work, but you can update application.properties if needed).

4. Use Postman (or another API client) to test the endpoints (e.g., /login, /register, /profile).
